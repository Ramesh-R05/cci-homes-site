It's transformative because it softens the look of a room and absorbs noise, creating a cosy, nurturing environment. \n\nTo choose the best carpet for your home, you'll want to think through these things:\n\n**1. Consider the way you live**\nIf you have a young family and pets then look for a hardwearing carpet in a forgiving colour, such as a textured loop pile or a quality hard-twist cut. If you're a couple looking for a touch of luxury, you might opt for a plush pile in a flat colour. If you're an entertainer, a combination cut and loop pile in mid-to-dark tones or a stippled cut pile would suit. \n\n**2. Think about plush piles**\nCut piles include plush piles, which are super soft and look like velvet. If you want that squishy, luxurious feeling then dense, plush-pile carpets are lovely, but bear in mind they show footprints. \n\n**3. Take a look at loop piles** \nLoop piles are exactly that; the yarn is formed into loops. There are lots of variations: some have a formal, linear look, some have a ribbed pattern, giving them a sisal look. Random loop piles give the carpet a textured, casual look.\n\n**4. Mix it up**\nCombination cut and loop pile carpets, where the contrasting textures create a light and dark pattern are less likely to show footprints and have a lovely texture underfoot.\n\n**5. Understand how carpet colour works**\nDarker colours help make a room appear cosier. Lighter colours make a room appear larger. A popular option is to choose a carpet that combines two colours in a subtle, neutral blend. It's more forgiving when it comes to stains. \n\n**6. Anticipate a fade**\nCarpet will appear lighter once installed and will fade over time, so choose one that is a shade or two deeper than you planned. \n\n**7. Consider your preferred fibre type**\nCarpets are available in 100-per-cent wool, wool-nylon mixes and myriad synthetic fibres. Wool is cool in summer and warm in winter â€“ and it's not necessarily more expensive. Of the synthetic fibres, solution-dyed nylon is the pick. It's generally fade resistant and soft to touch.\n\n**8. Lie on it**\nIf people in your family like to lounge on the floor, make sure you buy a heavy weight, dense carpet. The heavier a carpet sample, the more yarn it's likely to have.\n\n**9. Check the ratings**\nThere is a ratings system for Australian carpets. Look for a carpet that has an â€˜extra heavy duty grade' residential rating. And if you're carpeting stairs, make sure it has a stairs rating."

Give them room!**\nStainless steel is dishwasher-safe, but allow plenty of space between items to avoid movement during the cycle and prevent scratches. \n\n**2. Get them dry ASAP**\nWatch your washing habits to make your stainless steel cutlery last. Prolonged storage in a damp dishwasher can cause rust, so remove and hand-dry aÂ¬fter the cycle is finished. The same goes for handwashing â€“ make sure you dry your cutlery with a tea towel rather than leave it to air-dry.\n\n**3. Make friends with polish and white vinegar**\nA mild abrasive or metal polish will remove marks and stains from stainless steel. For water stains, rub in alcohol or salad oil. To maintain the shine, use a sponge with white vinegar.\n\n**4. Give your silver the silver treatment**\nSilver-plated and sterling-silver cutlery is best washed and dried by hand. It should be stored in a cutlery box or roll to reduce oxidisation, which causes silver to tarnish. If tarnish appears, remove with a quality silver cleaner.\n\n**5. Storage matters**\nStore stainless-steel cutlery in its original canteen to prevent pieces rubbing together. Storing in a kitchen drawer is fine but will reduce the lifespan."

And go easy when you install appliances, advises Kendall Waller, national product manager for [Premium Floors](http://www.premiumfloors.com.au/|target=\"_blank\").\n\nEach appliance should be moved across one sheet of MDF or masonite and straight onto a second one, â€˜leapfrogging' the sheets as you move the appliance to the right position.\n\nâ€œThis way, the appliance is never in contact with the floor, nor is anything dragged along the floor,â€ says Waller. â€œIf I had a dollar for every new floor I've seen damaged from appliance moves, I'd be rich!â€"

Oil-based coatings will scratch more readily than others, but they can easily be patch-coated as required.\n\nâ€œYou might need to touch things up between one and three times a year, depending on the pattern of use,â€ says Waller. Water and solvent-based polyurethanes are more durable but can't be patch-coated.\n\nâ€œThey'll leave application marks and you may see gloss variations,â€ Waller explains. â€œSo the whole floor needs to be re-coated, generally every three to seven years.â€"

The first of these moments is the welcoming party â€“ a flock of geese occupying the paddock beside the tree-lined driveway.\n\nGeese can be territorial, often protecting properties like guard dogs, but these birds barely look up when a newcomer arrives. \n\nOwner Jenny Lansell says a gaggle of these rather regal-looking birds was already in residence when she and her husband Cyril bought the property more than 20 years ago. As well as the geese, there were two timber cottages on the property; one was restored, the other replaced."

Jenny loves mass planting and a swathe of agapanthus edges the driveway, filling the garden with blue flowers in summer.\n\nâ€œThe site is sloping and exposed, so our priority was to create level areas and shelter,â€ says Jenny. Dry-stone terraces were built to the south of the new house, while to the north lawn terraces create a platform for enjoying the country views.\n\nHedges are another signature design element: a thick border of willow-leaved hakea (*Hakea salicifolia*) is planted along the boundary for shelter, while clipped hedges of fragrant Mexican orange blossom (*Choisya ternate*) enclose four sides of the house. There are also low hedges of coastal rosemary (*Westringia fruticosa*) â€˜Smokey'."

The blooms are followed in late summer by attractive red, yellow and orange â€˜crabs'.\n\nNext to the house is the birch lawn, inspired by the random planting theory promoted by the late noted Australian garden designer, Edna Walling. \n\nâ€œI read that Edna Walling tossed a bucket of potatoes out across the lawn to get a random planting pattern so we did that here,â€ says Jenny. â€œWe tossed the potatoes and planted a birch where each potato landed. It worked well.â€"

And this is not the only productive area of the garden: a short walk from the house there is an orchard, and beyond that a garden devoted to citrus and still more vegetable gardens, with a large area for pumpkins and raspberries. \n\nMartin is still helping Jenny shape her garden paradise, assisted these days by his son Shannon, who was three when his father started working at Willawong. â€œMartin's skill and vision have helped me develop this garden,â€ says Jenny. â€œIt's been a joint venture all the way.â€"

But the house â€“ once home to eminent Victorian educator, Sir James Darling â€“ got under their skin and the notion of restoring it to its former glory grew more appealing. \n\nâ€œWe were torn,â€ says Nicholas, an architect. â€œIn the end, we just couldn't bring ourselves to demolish it.â€ And so began the process of designing and building a structure that was sympathetic to the home's DNA yet true to the couple's vision. \n\nToday, the Murrays are relishing life in a four-bedroom home spread over two levels (plus basement wine cellar and car parking) that transitions the centuries beautifully. In restoring the original section of the house, Nicholas and Fiona re-used as many of the existing elements and materials as possible, including bricks, windows, fire surrounds, even curtains, which now hang in the formal living room. â€œWe wanted a memento of the previous owners. Call us sentimental!â€ says Fiona, with a laugh."

It's a quirky and very personal point of difference in a house that pushes so many design boundaries. \n\nâ€œWe found the wallpaper in the kitchen out the back of a paint shop in Port Melbourne â€“ it even smelled like the '70s,â€ says Fiona. â€œWe love it. It gives the kitchen real presence.â€ \n\nThere were many challenges during construction, but Fiona says she cherishes the time spent researching the history of the old girl. The beautiful Gothic Revival architecture â€“ now restored to its former glory â€“ gives barely a hint of the striking, ultra-modern home the Murrays have created around it. It's a family home for the ages."

The main guestroom â€“ and most contested room â€“ is layered with elaborate printed wallpaper and fabric. A bookshelf in the living room bursts with old volumes on floristry (Jane's passion) and vintage cars (most definitely Alan's). \n\nThe Garden Room, a gracious screened annex appended in the 1950s, is where Charles does much of his design work. Commissions for clients like [Herman Miller](http://www.hermanmiller.com/|target=\"_blank\"), [Woodmark](http://woodmark.com.au/|target=\"_blank\"), and [King Living](http://www.kingliving.com.au/|target=\"_blank\") are placed around the house. \n\nIn the living room, Charles' high-back Seymour swivels in a cut windowpane velour, a chunky matching ottoman at its feet. In the Bird Room, a Seymour low-back steel chair is upholstered in blue â€“ a serene resting point amid the cacophony of print."

There's even a hacksaw hanging in the kitchen for unwieldy cuts of meat. \n\nAt night, the curtains close with a gravitas that comes with thick linen lining and the carpets are soft underfoot. Encircled by an English-style garden, with endless paddocks beyond, and overlooked by what Charles calls â€˜welcome palms', it's an oasis of calm on a real working farm. \n\nCharles is clearly at ease here; when not wrangling with the original Aga to whip up memorable meals, he can be found outside, tending his plants."

He's as likely to wax lyrical about the proportions of French doors or the sash window panes as he is to debate the merits of Bauhaus. \n\nIt's intriguing to see his contemporary designs worked into this gracious heritage home. His latest design, the white onyx Atomic vase, adorns various rooms, and his Serif stool (an occasional seat that appears to be modelled on machinery debris) brings a modern industrial allure to the 19th-century setting. \n\nWhen back in Sydney, Charles lives in a stylish Art Deco apartment with a picture-postcard view of the harbour. Beautiful as it is, Droubalgie is where he's most at home."

But, as it was open to the sky, we covered it with hardwood battens topped with fibreglass roofing for weather protection.â€  \n\nThe previous kitchen was transformed into a welcoming entrance foyer with a new staircase tucked to one side. Above, a sky-lit double space void filters morning light deep into the newly-constructed downstairs kitchen/dining/living rooms."

A white screen with adjustable aluminium blades protecting the full faÃ§ade is a visor-like piece de resistance. In contrast, the laid-back, new outdoor room built from spotted gum softens the home's glass and steel-frame geometric lines. \n\nThroughout all the interiors, curated collections of flotsam and jetsam happily co-exist alongside pieces such as wall-mounted Andy Warhol skateboard decks, inherited vintage maps, ceramics, sculptures, indigenous artefacts and street art. Adding tactile interest is a palette of natural materials such as the cross-cut travertine that features around the fireplace.\n\nWhile it may be non-conformist, this home with its easy-breezy coastal vibe perfectly captures the family's heartbeat. â€œWe've filled it with items that we love and we use â€“ such as the surfboards and skateboards â€“ and there's enough space to have these out on display,â€ Patrick says."

It's best to do this when the soil is moist, so it can stay moist under the mulch. If it's windy, wet the newspaper as you work so it won't blow away. \n\nWhen you have a little more time, you can spray weeds in the garden before you smother them using either a glyphosatebased spray, such as Roundup or Zero, or an organic weed-killer such as Richgro Beat-a-Weed (based on vinegar and salt) or Amgrow Weed Blitz (based on pine oil)."

By using modern lines, natural materials and fresh, contemporary colours, they've achieved their goal: a fuss-free home that performs perfectly for their young family.\n\n\nThe innovative design was driven by nostalgia and shaped by the constraints of the sloping, 410m2 block in a beachside Perth suburb. â€œI spent my childhood holidays in an old-style stilt house, which I loved,â€ says Gerard. â€œWe mentioned this to our architects [Klopper & Davis Architects](http://www.kada.com.au/|target=\"_blank\") and they took the stilt concept to another level completely.â€"

Only 70m2 of the house touches the ground, leaving plenty of free space on the property.\n\n\nFrom the outset the concept wowed the couple and captured the imagination of their sons Harry and Sam, who followed each step of construction with excitement and dubbed the result â€œour floating houseâ€.\n\n\nThe exterior features reclaimed bricks from the site's original house. A long driveway ends at a yellow front door that opens to the lower ground floor. This space contains just two rooms: a study and a large, multi-functional space."

The last was a point of contention between husband and wife. â€œI wanted green and Gerard wanted yellow,â€ says the victor, Kristen, with a laugh. â€œThe pop of vibrant colour is a signature of the architects.â€"

On the top level is the large main bedroom, with windows that wrap around the exterior for ocean views.\n\n\nâ€œWhile the upstairs area is our escape, as a family we live in the main area, eating, playing and enjoying time together,â€ says Kristen. â€œThis house has given us everything that we need to live together happily and easily.â€"

They noticed bricks featured heavily and incorporated bricks from the site's original house in the exterior. â€œIt gives the house a grounded sort of feeling,â€ says Gerard.\n\n**2. Eco-friendly:** â€œWe have louvres at the front and back of the house, and at the top and bottom, so we have natural air movement that cools the house in summer,â€ says Kristen. â€œAnd, with the big windows on the northern side, our interior is naturally heated in winter.â€\n\n**3. Splish splash:**  The main bathroom used by Harry and Sam is completely waterproof. â€œIt is like a European-style wet room, which is brilliant!â€ says Gerard. â€œThe kids can splash and you don't have to worry.â€\n\n**4. Hole-proof:** The couple specified a hanging rail for displaying art in the living room. â€œWe had seen it somewhere and we thought it was a better idea than holes in the wall,â€ says Gerard.\n\n**5. Wash off:** The original plan was to have an outdoor shower in the backyard, but they decided to lay grass for the kids instead. â€œIt made sense to us to have the outdoor shower near the entrance for rinsing off after we've been to the beach,â€ says Gerard."

Also look for hidden storage opportunities, such as the backs of doors, where you can hang baskets. â€œWith proper organisation and the right storage tools you can reveal usable space you never even knew you had,â€ says Player."

Pull everything out and divide into three piles: everyday, occasional and deep archive. Throw out what you don't need. Â¬\n* Store frequently used items at hand height, occasionally used ones at shoulder height or above, and heavy items down low. Â¬\n* Keep the lawnmower and bikes near the garage door so they don't track in dirt. \n* Drawers are great for small, similar items. You can use the cabinet top as a work surface.\n* Create a â€˜clutter trap' near the door to the house to prevent mess entering â€“ think coat hooks, boot storage, and generous baskets."

Whereas, a basic L-shaped flat pack kitchen from Ikea with laminate benchtops and melamine cabinetry finishes will cost you about $1500-$2000. \n\nAdding appliances adds up to about $3000. If you would prefer a solid timber benchtop, factor in an extra $300-$400, while a Caesarstone benchtop will add about $1000-$1500 to the total.\n\nâ€œIn addition, rather than waiting six to eight weeks for a bespoke kitchen to be installed, you could pick up an off the-shelf design today and have it up by the end of the weekend,â€ says Prevade."

From about $60/mÂ², excluding installation.\n\n\n**Solid surface**\n\n\nThis material, usually made from acrylic and natural minerals, gives the seamless look of an integrated bench, sink and splashback in one piece. It can be made to fit awkward layouts without visible joins. From about $400/mÂ², installed.\n\n\n**Reconstituted/engineered stone**\n\n\nAvailable in a vast choice of colours and patterns, these are tougher than natural stone, easier to care for and cheaper, too. From around $450/mÂ², installed. Some are designed to be laid over the top of existing surfaces, so you can transform a kitchen without demolishing it. From about $380/mÂ², excluding installation."

Select plants that will thrive in particular conditions: they may need to withstand sun exposure, for example, or long periods of shade.\n* In windy spots, use robust pots with large bases and avoid tall, skinny shapes that will easily blow over.\n* Think about scale: make bold statements and avoid the use of small pots in confined spaces.\n* To keep the composition interesting, establish a strong focal point and use groupings of different plants.\n* Layer plants for a full look and take care to create interest in the foreground as well as in the distance.\n* Bring together different elements for textural contrast. For example, you might place a slick, minimalist white cylinder pot next to an antique or rustic timber one, or use soft, mounding foliage with architectural or grassy foliage."

It breathes, keeps your home warmer in winter and cooler in summer, provides acoustic protection, as well as being naturally fire- and stain-resistant.\n* **Wool-nylon blend:** Combines the beauty of wool with robust nylon, making it a good choice for family homes. As a rule, the higher the percentage of wool, the better the quality.\n* **Synthetic:** Nylon, polyester and Triexta (a synthetic made from renewable resources) are durable, stain-resistant and pop back into shape even under heavy footfall. They're also less likely to fade. For superior fade-resistance and vibrancy, look for solution-dyed nylons where the colour permeates the entire fibre.\n* **Natural flooring:** Woven jute, sisal and coir are durable, have textural appeal, are good at dampening noise and regulating temperature. They are not suited to wet areas such as laundries and bathrooms.\n\nOf all carpet materials, synthetics have perhaps seen the biggest advances in recent years, to the point where it's often hard to distinguish the quality ones from wool. \n\nNew synthetics offer all manner of appealing features too, including advanced stain-blocking and fade resistance that are specially designed to withstand our harsh Aussie climate. They also offer anti-odour and antibacterial protection, which is great for homes with kids or pets."

In these areas, living on the water is a whole way of life to many, so the idea of a pool has value.\n\nBuilding a pool in a cooler climate is generally not a good idea as it can only be used for a few months of the year. I've seen cases where people have spent hundreds of thousands on heated indoor pools and haven't been able to recover anything like that when they sell. \n\nBefore making a decision, look at the local market. Do most houses in your area have pools? If not, there may be a good reason. A pool may reduce your pool of potential buyers (pardon the pun) because those who don't want a pool will cross you off their list. Those who do can always build one themselves. If it's an upmarket area in a warm climate, however, having a pool may be an expectation."

Look at the potential costs and site constraints, too. \n\nA pool may be cost effective if you have a level block with good access for machinery. But if it's a sloping site, or rocky, or it has difficult access or underground services that have to be relocated, the costs may outweigh the benefits. â€œSome buyers may see a pool as an inconvenience and shy away from buying a property that includes one, but equally, many buyers prefer to have a pool and may be willing to pay extra to secure one,â€ says Angus Raine, chairman and CEO of real estate group [Raine & Horne](http://www.raineandhorne.com.au/|target=\"_blank\"). \n\nâ€œIf you are investing in a pool, you must be careful that it doesn't dominate your outdoor space and leave you with little or no yard. Just like your home, the presentation and maintenance of your pool will go a long way to determining how much of an asset it is when it comes time to sell.â€"

All these issues need to be researched, discussed and resolved before you make a decision.\n\nThen you must decide what you take with you, what is passed on to family, and what goes into a garage sale or donated to charity. \n\nYou may need to hang on to that box trailer just a little longer, but that geriatric lawnmower and the suit you got married in could be the first things to go."

Consider an extra room that can serve as study/reading room/guestroom. \n* If downsizing for retirement, consider single-level properties or those with at least one downstairs bedroom and bathroom, in case climbing stairs becomes a problem in the future.  \n\n\n*Source:* [First National](http://firstnational.com.au/downsizing |target=\"_blank\")"
