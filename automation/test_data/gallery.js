This property would be perfect for entertaining family and friends, with its central pool and outdoor spa. It also had a self-contained cabin in the yard which would be a handy sleep-out for their guests.\n\nThe L-shaped home consists of two wings. On one side are the main bedroom and another bedroom. The larger leg of the L includes two more bedrooms, a lounge room and an open-plan area with living room and kitchen. The kitchen overlooks the pool and outdoor entertaining areas, through sliding doors. The kitchen has a servery window which opens to the pool area and is ideal for serving drinks and platters when she has friends around – which is often."

And, as owner of homewares company, DKNA, she’s never short of ideas. What is her style? “Retro modern.” And it’s there in her favourite item, the 1960s sideboard in the dining room, which instantly creates a mid-century vibe."

Because it’s adaptable, it allows the surface areas to change and evolve.” This place is rarely the same from one day to the next.\n\nShe’s always on the lookout for that special retro find, such as that sideboard and the Hans Wegner-inspired armchairs in the living room, which she got for a snip, and eBay finds, such as the starburst clock in the main bedroom. She prefers to shop locally, as much as she can. As well as original pieces, she has added in a few replicas, an instant short cut to good style, she says, such as the lookalike Eames chairs in the dining area and Kartell Componibili cabinets."

With the emphasis on the outdoors, the overall vibe is laid-back and relaxed, which is not surprising, considering the family who lives here. Dani’s philosophy on decorating is, “have fun when you decorate. Your space, your home, your interior should be a reflection of you and your family’s personalities. Always changing, always evolving, always you.”"

When you find yourself drowning in piles of paper or constantly searching for missing items, you know it’s time for a storage overhaul.\n \n“No matter how large or small your home is, having simple, easy-to-use storage systems in place is essential for the ordered running of your life,” says Sydney interior designer [Denai Kulcsar](http://www.dkinteriors.com.au/|target=\"_blank\"). “It saves time, hassle and, in the long run, money, because you won’t double up on items you already own. You don’t need to spend a fortune, but you do need to think smart.”\n\nThe latest designs offer solutions to just about any storage challenge. From cheap and cheerful stackable containers to cabinets and shelves that fit into awkward corners, plus flexible, show-stopping designs that look great – there’s no excuse not to get organised."

These pieces are made to be noticed.\n\n“Wall storage in particular has undergone a huge transformation,” says Kulcsar. “With many resembling works of art in eye-popping brights and beautiful finishes, often you can’t even tell they’re for storage.”\n\nIntriguing designs that hang from the ceiling or appear to run helter-skelter up the wall, shelves with concealed fittings that appear to float in mid-air, and seemingly unexpected mixes of materials, such as timber and coloured steel, frosted glass and leather are all options."

Select plants that will thrive in particular conditions: they may need to withstand sun exposure, for example, or long periods of shade.\n* In windy spots, use robust pots with large bases and avoid tall, skinny shapes that will easily blow over.\n* Think about scale: make bold statements and avoid the use of small pots in confined spaces.\n* To keep the composition interesting, establish a strong focal point and use groupings of different plants.\n* Layer plants for a full look and take care to create interest in the foreground as well as in the distance.\n* Bring together different elements for textural contrast. For example, you might place a slick, minimalist white cylinder pot next to an antique or rustic timber one, or use soft, mounding foliage with architectural or grassy foliage."

Think of them as an alternative feature wall – in open plan living spaces, ceiling-fixed curtains can look great creating a vertical soft wall behind a sofa to help define a space within a space. This kind of treatment can also improve the feeling of height in a room with low ceilings by adding a strong vertical line, which creates a visual illusion."

Avoid over-stacking – no more than four plates high – as the weight can weaken the rims and cause damage. Cups and mugs should not be stacked or hung by their handles, which can result in cracks or scratches. \n\nAnd be mindful of extreme temperature changes. “For example, never transfer a bone china plate straight from the fridge into a hot oven,” says Varley.

So I wanted to open up the space, install a functional kitchen and internal laundry, and reopen the original doorway into the bedroom [positioned to line up with bedroom and living windows] to allow both natural air-flow through the apartment and to make more of the light.” Mary asked architect/interior designer Brooke Aitken for help."

But it was instantly obvious what she could do to improve the layout. “The galley kitchen was a separate room to the living space so just by knocking down the wall between them and grouping the spaces we added significant spatial feeling,” she explains. \n\nA new kitchen was installed, with a favourite piece – a Tasmanian oak bench – substituting for a dining table that wouldn’t fit in the space. It was treated with [Porter’s Paints](http://www.porterspaints.com/|target=\"_blank\") Lime Wax with a lime finish in White, rubbed in by hand.  \n\n“It can be rewaxed any time and come back to the original finish,” Brooke explains. “I love the handcrafted feel, and it harks back to the historical nature of the building, which was built at a time that polyurethane was not known.”"

The corridor space was wasted just for walking – in a small, one-bed apartment, every millimetre counts to be used as ‘working’ space,” she reiterates."

Cups and mugs should not be stacked or hung by their handles, which can result in cracks or scratches. \n\nAnd be mindful of extreme temperature changes. “For example, never transfer a bone china plate straight from the fridge into a hot oven,” says Varley.

Soft, feathery fronds of asparagus follow the spring harvest of spears. On one side of the asparagus patch is an espaliered apple; on the other, rhubarb. Herbs are tucked into spare spaces.",

For the first five years we just kept digging up rocks and used them to make the retaining walls.” The garden terraces now support an astonishing variety of food plants including potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, cucumbers, onions, garlic, shallots, bok choy, rhubarb and asparagus. “Last spring was the best ever for asparagus,” says Jan. “I have four plants, just enough for me. I love it.” \n\nAlong the fences grow raspberries, marionberries and other hybrid blackberries, plus a venerable espaliered ‘Golden Delicious’ apple tree. “My uncle had a collection of espaliered fruit trees and I became quite fascinated with them,” says Jan. “They’re great space-savers.”"

It breathes, keeps your home warmer in winter and cooler in summer, provides acoustic protection, as well as being naturally fire- and stain-resistant.\n* **Wool-nylon blend:** Combines the beauty of wool with robust nylon, making it a good choice for family homes. As a rule, the higher the percentage of wool, the better the quality.\n* **Synthetic:** Nylon, polyester and Triexta (a synthetic made from renewable resources) are durable, stain-resistant and pop back into shape even under heavy footfall. They’re also less likely to fade. For superior fade-resistance and vibrancy, look for solution-dyed nylons where the colour permeates the entire fibre.\n* **Natural flooring:** Woven jute, sisal and coir are durable, have textural appeal, are good at dampening noise and regulating temperature. They are not suited to wet areas such as laundries and bathrooms.\n\nOf all carpet materials, synthetics have perhaps seen the biggest advances in recent years, to the point where it’s often hard to distinguish the quality ones from wool. \n\nNew synthetics offer all manner of appealing features too, including advanced stain-blocking and fade resistance that are specially designed to withstand our harsh Aussie climate. They also offer anti-odour and antibacterial protection, which is great for homes with kids or pets."

In fact, they’re completely off-the-wall in terms of style – modern tiles embrace imitation textures and can resemble, fabric, wood, leather, glass and paper, and they are even available in 3D shapes.\n\n\nNot only do they look great, tiles can be a very cost-effective way decorate your home, particularly in high-traffic areas and moisture-rich environments."

It helps control the functionality and durability of tiles and plays a major role in day-to-day maintenance and the overall longevity of your tile.\n\n\nGrout divides and frames tiles, and can highlight individual tile shapes or patterns. Grout is a whole other design decision so give it the consideration it deserves.\n\n\nThere are three approaches when it comes to choosing grout colour:\n\n\n* **Matching grout**\nMatching the grout colour to the tile colour makes the grout lines less pronounced and therefore the tile itself is accentuated. This is the best option if you have over-the-top beautiful tiles with a basic layout.\n\n* **Contrasting grout**\nA contrasting grout colour and tile colour will emphasize both the pattern and layout of the tiles, rather than the tile itself.\n\n* **Neutral grout**\nA light, neutral grout produces a look somewhere in between matching and contrast."

Avoid over-stacking – no more than four plates high – as the weight can weaken the rims and cause damage. Cups and mugs should not be stacked or hung by their handles, which can result in cracks or scratches. \n\nAnd be mindful of extreme temperature changes. “For example, never transfer a bone china plate straight from the fridge into a hot oven,” says Varley.

Alterations had left it with ceilings of various heights and mixed floor treatments. To make it more family-friendly, the owners wanted sightlines from one space to the next, in order to keep an eye on their children as they played. That would also mean whoever was in the kitchen preparing food could chat with frequent visitors."

The idea was that Denai would bring warmth and a dash of glamour to Tanya’s streamlined floor plan.\n\nKeeping largely within the existing envelope on three sides, Tanya extended the front of the house to create a new double-height hallway. She enclosed the carport to make a double garage and added a new bedroom above it. The opening between the kitchen and living area was enlarged, with a window splashback to introduce more light and soothing green glimpses."

Denai has also woven in some of the owners’ existing furniture, much of it tribal and Asian inspired.\n\nAmong new finishes, the glamour factor is evident in tactile wallpapers, sheer linen curtains and metallic tiles.\n\nAlmost inevitably, the project expanded in scope from its original concept. “We did more than we intended,” says the owner with a smile, but, as she looks around her home, it’s clear she has no regrets."

    "content": "China comes in several forms, including fine bone china, porcelain and stoneware. “Despite its delicate appearance, fine bone china is actually the strongest,” says Jane Varley, marketing manager at WWRD Australia, distributors of *Waterford*, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton and Royal Albert ranges. \n\n“Many people are scared to use fine china, but they shouldn’t be,” says Joseph D’Rozario, butler at The Hotel Windsor in Melbourne, where afternoon tea is served on Noritake fine china. “It’s there to be enjoyed, and with proper care should last a lifetime.”  "

Varley agrees. “Rinse pieces before placing them in the machine and make sure that items don’t bump against each other.” She advises using a gentle wash cycle with a maximum temperature of 65˚C. "

Avoid over-stacking – no more than four plates high – as the weight can weaken the rims and cause damage. Cups and mugs should not be stacked or hung by their handles, which can result in cracks or scratches. \n\nAnd be mindful of extreme temperature changes. “For example, never transfer a bone china plate straight from the fridge into a hot oven,” says Varley.
