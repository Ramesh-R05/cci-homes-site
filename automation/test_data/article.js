But try this scenario. Let’s say you leave a large share of your assets to your son who is currently married but childless. After you die, his marriage breaks up and he re-marries, to a woman that you’ve never met with children from a previous relationship. Your son then dies and your assets end up with his “new” family, rather than your own bloodline. Or this one. Your daughter is currently married to a man who has problems with drinking and gambling. You want to provide for her if you die, but how do you do so without running the risk that your not-so-favourite son-in-law will fritter the money away? Or perhaps it’s your child who has a problem and you want to ensure that while they benefit from their inheritance, they’re not going to blow it and be left with nothing."

Balalovski says testamentary trusts can also offer protection if you’re worried about your child going bankrupt or separating from their partner. He says assets in a testamentary trust are usually recognised as a resource of the beneficiary, but are not generally regarded as a marital asset. So while your son or daughter might have their share of the marital assets adjusted to take into account the inheritance, if it’s in a testamentary trust it usually won’t be split."

After you die, his marriage breaks up and he re-marries, to a woman that you’ve never met with children from a previous relationship. Your son then dies and your assets end up with his “new” family, rather than your own bloodline. Or this one. Your daughter is currently married to a man who has problems with drinking and gambling. You want to provide for her if you die, but how do you do so without running the risk that your not-so-favourite son-in-law will fritter the money away? Or perhaps it’s your child who has a problem and you want to ensure that while they benefit from their inheritance, they’re not going to blow it and be left with nothing."

He says assets in a testamentary trust are usually recognised as a resource of the beneficiary, but are not generally regarded as a marital asset. So while your son or daughter might have their share of the marital assets adjusted to take into account the inheritance, if it’s in a testamentary trust it usually won’t be split."

                            content:"This year has shaping up as a positive one for sharemarket investors despite a mid-year dip. Stocks paying attractive dividends, including Woolworths, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and ASX, have performed well. The second, offsetting trend has been falls in the largest mining stocks. This has masked the strong performance of industrial companies. BHP Billiton is down for the year despite recovering from its mid-year lows and the same is true for Rio Tinto and Newcrest Mining. The price/value equation has changed since the beginning of the year. Prices are up, there’s been a marked slowdown in the resources industry and a sharp deterioration in government finances. There’s still plenty of risk in the Australian economy and in the wider world, too. So I think now is a time for more caution. For those with an established portfolio, I recommend accepting that the future is unpredictable and that you prepare for a range of different outcomes. Betting heavily on a single potential future is not my style. I’m no fortune teller, so in recent weeks I’ve been taking a few profits. Not selling out altogether, just re-balancing a portion of the portfolios I manage away from shares into cash. If this sounds like a sensible course of action to you, it raises two questions. The first is what to sell. The banks are top of the list, in my view. They’ve had a great run this year and many investors have a large percentage of their portfolios invested in them. But these stocks would be in the firing line in a number of scenarios such as a broad China-led economic downturn or another chapter in the history of global financial crises. In short, the banks are a bountiful area from which to take profits. I’ve also been trimming holdings in a few smaller, riskier stocks that have run up strongly. I don’t want to be too prescriptive, though. What I’m really suggesting is that you consider your current share investments and ask a few questions. How would you feel if the market fell by 15% or 20%? Are you over-exposed to shares in general or any one sector or stock? If so, it might be a good time to act. As a mentor of mine advises, “if you’re going to panic, panic early”. In other words, the time to prepare for the next downturn is during the upturn, not once things have started going awry. The second question is why sell a share that might be giving you a 5% dividend return to put the money in a savings account earning less than 4% and offering no potential for capital gains? It’s an understandable question. The answer revolves around the concept of risk - something that’s all too easy to forget when markets are being kind to you. Returns from cash should not be directly compared with the dividends from shares because they have vastly different risk profiles. In the next sharemarket downturn, when your share portfolio is falling day by day, your cash pile will be inching forward, accruing its (admittedly modest) interest payments. Simply put, while cash offers no chance of capital gains, nor does it offer the chance of capital loss. This serves a twofold purpose. It provides protection in the event of market falls and acts as a source of “dry powder” for future opportunities. When stocks are falling, it’s better to have cash at the ready than be forced into selling other stocks that you may want to hold for the long term when they’re taking a dive too. Looking at it another way: sometimes you have to accept a lower return in the short term to set yourself up for better results over the long term. This is a key lesson from some of the world’s best sharemarket investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman (an American billionaire who’s not as famous as Buffett but has a long record of similar returns). Exactly how much of your portfolio to convert into cash is a personal choice. But the more conservative you are, or the less able you are to cope with a hefty setback, the more cash you should consider holding at this point. If your share portfolio was 90% or 95% invested at the beginning of the year, you might pull that back closer to 80% or 85% today. And if the market continues to rise, you should generally “lean into the wind” and sell down further. At some point, the market will hit a bump and you want to be ready to take advantage of it. If you’re newer to investing and currently don’t own many shares, there’s no reason to be especially fearful. I don’t believe we’re in a boom environment that warrants undue concern. It’s just that quality stocks have gone from being quite attractive at the beginning of this year to around fair value today. So if you’re in the process of building a long-term portfolio, please don’t be put off by my caution. If you’re buying stocks (or managed funds) slowly by applying savings over months or years, you should stick to that plan. For me, the sharemarket needle has moved from “reasonably attractive” at the start of 2013 to “neutral” today. Pockets of value still exist, but when valuations are in neutral territory there’s every chance that better value will appear down the road. With the exception of the banks, the stocks I mentioned earlier can still be added to long-term portfolios (Woolworths and ASX). Computershare is another that should offer good potential over the coming years, too (though its dividend yield is lower and not fully franked). If you want to make a killing, though, you have to buy stocks when they’re dirt cheap. And we’re currently a fair way from that situation. So, next to a growing pile of cash I’m keeping a bedrock of quality blue-chip shares plus a few of my favourite smaller stocks to spice things up. The rest are facing the chop. Think of it as a spring clean. Greg Hoffman is an independent financial educator, commentator and investor and a director of the Intelligent Investor group of companies.
