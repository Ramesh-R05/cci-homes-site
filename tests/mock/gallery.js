Avoid over-stacking – no more than four plates high – as the weight can weaken the rims and cause damage. Cups and mugs should not be stacked or hung by their handles, which can result in cracks or scratches. \n\nAnd be mindful of extreme temperature changes. “For example, never transfer a bone china plate straight from the fridge into a hot oven,” says Varley.

Avoid over-stacking – no more than four plates high – as the weight can weaken the rims and cause damage. Cups and mugs should not be stacked or hung by their handles, which can result in cracks or scratches. \n\nAnd be mindful of extreme temperature changes. “For example, never transfer a bone china plate straight from the fridge into a hot oven,” says Varley.

Avoid over-stacking – no more than four plates high – as the weight can weaken the rims and cause damage. Cups and mugs should not be stacked or hung by their handles, which can result in cracks or scratches. \n\nAnd be mindful of extreme temperature changes. “For example, never transfer a bone china plate straight from the fridge into a hot oven,” says Varley.
