When we first went to look at the house for sale, I noticed there were lots of families out and about at the local parks, riding their bikes, so the suburb seemed to have a real sense of family and community spirit.

And we get lots of wildlife visiting – possums, cockatoos, scrub turkeys, rabbits, bandicoots, blue tongue lizards and the odd snake!"
